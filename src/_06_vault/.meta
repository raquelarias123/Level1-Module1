  # Vault


  A vault stands in the way of your progress. We need a secret agent to find the code
  to get through.

  1. You have been given a Vault class that describes how the vault will work. It
  has a secret code that will be randomly chosen each time the program is run.

  It also contains a tryCode() method that takes a number as a parameter and returns
  true if that number opens the vault, false otherwise.


  2. Create a Runner class with a main method. Create a vault object and call the
  tryCode() method. Print out the answer to see if you successfully opened the vault.


  3. Make a SecretAgent class that has a method findCode() that takes a Vault as a
  parameter.

  The codes are between 0 and 1 million. This method will try all the codes, and return
  the first code that opens the vault, or -1 if no code opened the vault.


  4. Add the SecretAgent object to main. Use a syso to print the result from findCode()
