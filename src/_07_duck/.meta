  1. Create a Duck class in your java project. Add its member variables and methods
  to match the picture above. Now add the code for the constructor of the Duck class:

  Duck(String favoriteFood, int numberOfFriends) {

  this.favoriteFood = favoriteFood;

  this.numberOfFriends = numberOfFriends;

  }

  2. Now pick your favorite animal and describe it with at least 2 member variables
  and 2 methods.


  3. Create a java class for your animal including:

  member variables

  methods(with sysouts)

  a constructor that sets the member variables


  4. Create a new java class. This will be a "runner" or "driver" class, so it will
  need a main method.


  5. In your runner class, create a Duck object (instance) by calling its constructor
  as follows:

  Duck daffy = new Duck("donuts",5);

  Now you have a duck object, you can make it quack:

  daffy.quack();

  6. Now create an instance of your animal (Hint: see step 5 above) and call its methods.
